## About the Design

I focused on creating a clean, professional, and modern UI that reflects my personal branding as a Flutter developer. I chose a blue-based color palette to convey trust and consistency. The layout is simple and well-structured, allowing users to explore my profile, skills, and background without distractions. Rounded cards, spacing, and subtle shadows make the interface visually appealing. Each section, from education and hobbies to contact details and social links, is organized clearly. My design goal was to build a smooth, intuitive experience that highlights who I am in a visually engaging and user-friendly way.
